# BloodMatch — Project Context

> **This file is the permanent source of truth for understanding the BloodMatch system before making implementation decisions.**
> Read this file before writing any code, changing architecture, or making claims about what is implemented.
> Where any earlier section conflicts with the ratified rules in §9 (Finalized BloodMatch Business Rules), **§9 prevails**.

---

## 1. Project Overview

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **System Name** | BloodMatch |
| **Full Title** | "Blood Match – Development of a Peer-to-Peer Blood Donor Matching Platform Utilizing Biological Substitution Hierarchy and Proximity Sorting for DeMolay Group" |
| **Type** | Web-based blood donor matching platform |
| **Audience** | Exclusively for members of the DeMolay organization (Bataan) |

BloodMatch makes it easier for a person who needs blood to find a potentially compatible donor within the organization. Instead of relying on scattered social media posts ("Need blood donor, Blood Type O+, urgently needed"), the system organizes donor information and uses **blood compatibility matching** plus **location/proximity filtering** to identify potential donors.

---

## 2. Core Problem

The current manual process of finding blood donors is:

- Slow
- Unorganized
- Dependent on social media posts
- Difficult to search
- Difficult to determine compatible blood types
- Difficult to identify nearby donors
- Difficult for officers to verify legitimate members
- Difficult to keep donor information updated

**Example:** A member needs A+ blood. Instead of posting on Facebook and waiting, BloodMatch searches its registered donor database and identifies potentially compatible donors based on:

1. Blood type compatibility
2. Donor availability/status
3. Location/proximity
4. Verification status

The system is a **structured matching platform**, not a social media site.

---

## 3. Target Users & Roles (3-Tier RBAC)

BloodMatch is intended exclusively for DeMolay members. There are three primary roles.

### 3.1 Member / Donor

A normal registered DeMolay member can:

- Create an account / log in
- Maintain their profile
- Provide blood type information
- Register as a donor
- Indicate donor availability
- View blood requests
- Search for compatible blood donors
- Receive notifications
- Respond to blood requests
- View their donor/request activity

A member can be **both** a blood donor and a blood requestor — no separate accounts are needed.

### 3.2 Officer / Admin

Designated DeMolay officers manage and verify users. They can:

- Review registered members
- Verify member identity / submitted documents
- Approve/reject accounts
- Manage users
- Monitor blood requests and donor activity
- View system activity, reports, and analytics
- Manage/monitor system records

Officers are trusted administrative users.

### 3.3 System Administrator

The highest-level administrative role. May have access to:

- User management
- Officer management
- System configuration
- Reports & analytics
- Audit logs
- Administrative controls

> Exact permissions must follow the project's **existing RBAC implementation** and must not be expanded without a requirement.

---

## 4. Main Purpose & Scope Boundaries

**Central objective:** Connect blood requestors with potentially compatible and available donors within the DeMolay organization.

**What BloodMatch is NOT:**

- ❌ It does **not replace hospitals, doctors, blood banks, or professional medical services**
- ❌ It is **NOT Facebook** — the Facebook-like aspect refers only to a familiar social-style interface where appropriate
- ✅ It **is** a matching and coordination platform; final medical suitability is determined by qualified professionals and the receiving facility

### 4.1 Out of Scope

Unless a future requirement explicitly adds them, BloodMatch does **NOT** require:

- Friends/followers
- Likes/reactions
- Generic social-media feed
- Stories
- Public donor directory
- Public blood-type directory
- General-purpose messaging platform
- Messenger clone
- Social-media sharing system

The system may use familiar social-platform interaction *patterns* in its UI where appropriate, but those are not core BloodMatch functional requirements and must not be built without an explicit new requirement.

---

## 5. Core Workflow

```
STEP 1: Member Registration → STEP 2: Account Verification → STEP 3: Blood Request
        → STEP 4: Matching Engine → STEP 5: Proximity Sorting
        → STEP 6: Donor Notification → STEP 7: Requestor–Donor Connection
```

### Step 1 — Member Registration

Member creates an account providing: name, contact info, blood type, DeMolay/member info (chapter, date of birth), account credentials, mandatory Privacy Notice acknowledgment (`privacy_acknowledged`), and other required registration data. Location is **not** collected during registration (raw `latitude`/`longitude` on register are rejected with `location_id` guidance); the Bataan municipality/barangay selector is used after registration via Profile (`PUT /api/profile { location_id }`).

### Step 2 — Account Verification

An authorized officer reviews submitted info/documents and can:

- Approve
- Reject
- Request correction/review

Only appropriately verified accounts participate in sensitive donor/request workflows, per the project's existing rules.

### Step 3 — Blood Request

A requestor creates a request containing: required blood type, amount/unit info where applicable, location/facility, urgency, needed date/time, additional info, and request status.

### Step 4 — Matching Engine

Analyzes registered donors using the predefined **biological substitution hierarchy** (see §6).

### Step 5 — Location / Proximity Sorting

Prioritizes compatible donors who are realistically closer to the request location.

### Step 6 — Donor Notification

Matching donors receive smart notifications (in-app + email, with duplicate/consecutive-notification prevention — see §9.7).

### Step 7 — Requestor–Donor Connection

Establishes a connection between requestor and donor.

> ⚠️ A "connection" does **NOT** necessarily mean live chat. The core functionality is matching/coordination itself. If live chat exists or is added, it is a communication feature **on top of** the matching system — never the core mechanism.

---

## 6. Key Feature: Smart Cascading Match Engine

Identifies compatible donors rather than only identical blood types. The engine uses **red-cell transfusion compatibility only** (ABO + Rh rules). Plasma, platelet, and whole-blood compatibility are out of scope. Results never replace clinical blood typing, crossmatching, or professional medical judgment.

**Example — recipient requires A+:**
Compatible donor types may include:

1. A+
2. A-
3. O+
4. O-

Matches should be ranked appropriately using this priority order:

```
Compatibility → Availability → Verification → Proximity
```

> ⚠️ The system must **never** prioritize a nearby incompatible donor over a compatible donor. Compatibility is the primary requirement; distance is only a ranking/filtering factor.

### Architectural Rule (critical)

- The compatibility matrix must be **stored centrally and consistently**.
- Do **not** scatter blood compatibility logic across React components, PHP pages, APIs, or SQL queries.
- Use a reusable backend service/function such as `BloodCompatibilityService`, `MatchService`, or a `CompatibilityMatrix`.
- **The backend is the authoritative source of matching logic.**

---

## 7. Location-Based Matching

Proximity sorting prioritizes donors closer to the requestor/request location/chapter. **Current canonical architecture (migrations 015–016, verified 2026-09-24):** Municipality/City + optional Barangay → `bataan_locations` (12 + 237 rows, PSGC 030800000) → backend-resolved reference coordinates (`users.location_id` / `blood_requests.location_id` FKs; `latitude`/`longitude` hold backend-derived points) → proximity ranking via `Geo::distanceKm` (Haversine) in `MatchService`. Location is **not** an eligibility gate; exact user coordinates are not user-entered through the new selector; barangay selection is an administrative label until distinct reliable coordinates are seeded; request location (`blood_requests.location_id`) remains separate from user profile location (`users.location_id`). Legacy latitude/longitude records without `location_id` are still matched (distance computed where present). Chapter membership is **never** a hard filter (see §9.3). Chapter canonical centroids (chapters table) are used only by the Demand Map, never as donor/request locations.

**DeMolay chapters in Bataan:**

| Chapter | Location |
|---|---|
| Mt. Samat Chapter | Orani |
| Mt. Tarak Chapter | Mariveles |
| Meridian Heights Chapter | Balanga City |

---

## 8. Additional Modules

### 8.1 Regional Blood Demand Map

Visualizes where blood requests/demand occur. Helps officers understand:

- Which chapters have more requests
- Which blood types are frequently requested
- Demand patterns
- Regional shortages
- Activity trends

### 8.2 Officer Verification Module

Officers review submissions and verify users are legitimate members. Account statuses distinguish between:

- Registered
- Pending verification
- Verified
- Rejected
- Deactivated

> ⚠️ **Existing project decision:** Donor-card documents do **not** act as a hard gate in the same way as a national ID. Do not change this behavior unless the project specification explicitly changes.
>
> Ratified lifecycle, permission matrix, separation-of-duties, and age-eligibility rules: see §9.2.

### 8.3 Automated Soft-Deactivation

Instead of permanently deleting users/records, the system deactivates them — preserving historical records and database integrity.

- Soft-deactivated accounts are excluded from normal donor matching
- Implemented via e.g. `active = 1` or a more explicit status system
- Do **not** permanently delete records unless requirements explicitly call for it

### 8.4 Donor Availability

Being compatible does not mean currently available. Potential statuses:

- Available
- Unavailable
- Standby
- Deactivated

Only appropriate active/available donors normally appear as active matches.

> Standby/cooldown mechanics, donation confirmation, and reactivation rules: see §9.6.

### 8.5 Smart Email Notifications

Automated email notifications for:

- Account verification updates
- Password reset
- Blood request alerts
- Donor match notifications
- Important system notifications

> Anti-spam rule: if one event causes a notification, the same event must not repeatedly generate identical notifications.

### 8.6 Password Reset

Specified behavior (implementation status: see §10):

- Reset tokens are **hashed**
- Tokens are **single-use**
- Tokens expire after approximately **30 minutes**
- Passwords must be securely hashed
- Reset tokens must never be stored or exposed as plain reusable credentials

**Requirement texts supplied by the product owner on 2026-08-26 (verbatim):**

- **FR-01 — User Registration:** The system shall allow DeMolay Bataan members to create an account by providing the required personal, chapter, and blood-related information.
- **FR-02 — User Login and Logout:** The system shall allow registered users to securely log in and log out of their accounts.
- **FR-04 — User Profile Management:** The system shall allow users to view and update their personal information, blood type, chapter, contact information, and donor availability.

### 9.2 Accounts, Statuses & Permissions (FR-03, FR-10, FR-11)

**Account lifecycle:**

```
Registered → Pending Verification → Verified
                                     ↙      ↘
                                Rejected   Deactivated
                                   ↓ (resubmission allowed)
                             Pending Verification
```

**Capability matrix:**

| Status | Browse requests | Create blood request | Become donor | Appear in matches | Notifications |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Registered | Limited | No | No | No | Account-related only |
| Pending | Yes | Yes — request marked *pending review* | No | No | Yes, relevant system notifications |
| Verified | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes, if available | Yes |
| Rejected | No | No | No | No | Rejection/status notifications only |
| Deactivated | No | No | No | No | None |

**Rationale:** being unverified must not prevent someone from *asking for help*; it only prevents them from being *presented as a donor*.

**Verification evidence & blood-type data model:**

- Identity/membership verification does **not** require a donor card; the donor card is **supplementary** supporting evidence for blood-related information.
- A document never makes BloodMatch the final authority on medical compatibility.
- Blood type is modeled with three fields: `blood_type`, `blood_type_source` (e.g., `Donor Card` / `Self Reported`), `blood_type_verified` (boolean).
- Unverified (self-reported) blood type may participate in matching but must **never be represented to users as medically confirmed**.

**Separation of duties (mandatory):**

- A Chapter Officer verifies only members of their **assigned chapter**: review info/documents, approve, reject, request re-review/correction.
- No account may approve or verify **itself**. Officers cannot verify: themselves, another officer, or a System Administrator; modify their own verification status; or approve their own documents.
- Routine cross-chapter verification is prohibited; it requires explicit System Administrator authorization.
- Officers are created/verified/activated by the **System Administrator**, who also assigns officers to chapters, deactivates officers, reviews escalated cases, and overrides verification decisions where necessary.

**Age eligibility (Philippine guidance):**

| Age | Rule |
|---|---|
| Under 16 | Cannot participate as eligible donor |
| 16–17 | May register as potential donor **only with documented parental/guardian consent**; still subject to medical screening |
| 18+ | Normal registration as potential donor |

BloodMatch checks **administrative prerequisites only** (age rule + account verification + required consent + donor requirements). Actual donation always depends on medical screening by an authorized blood facility.

### 9.3 Cascading Match Engine (FR-06, FR-08)

- **Red-cell transfusion compatibility only** (ABO + Rh). No plasma/platelet/whole-blood calculations. Output is advisory, never a substitute for clinical typing/crossmatching/professional judgment.
- The engine runs **automatically when a request is created**, is **re-run when relevant donor/request eligibility information changes**, and may be **manually re-run by authorized users** for an active request.
- Re-running updates the existing match set — it never creates duplicate matches or duplicate notifications.
- A new notification occurs only on a **materially new match event** (see §9.7).
- **Chapter membership is NOT a hard eligibility filter.** All otherwise eligible compatible donors are considered regardless of chapter. Users may optionally filter *displayed* results by chapter, but display filtering can never override compatibility, verification, availability, or other mandatory eligibility requirements.

### 9.4 Match Prioritization & Proximity (FR-07, FR-08)

Priority order (unchanged): `Compatibility → Availability → Verification → Proximity`.

- Proximity = distance computed from backend-resolved donor/request reference coordinates (e.g., Haversine via `Geo`), used as a ranking factor among eligible compatible donors. Coordinates come from canonical `bataan_locations` resolution (`location_id`), never from client-supplied raw coordinates (raw keys rejected 400).
- Same-chapter donors may receive a ranking preference where applicable.
- Exact coordinates are **never exposed to other users** (match results expose `approximate_distance_km` only; selector APIs expose no coordinates).
- **Urgency** affects outreach breadth and notification priority only (critical → broader cross-chapter outreach); it never overrides compatibility, verification, or eligibility rules.
- Donor profile location change triggers `MatchService::refreshMatchesForDonor()`: affected OPEN matches are recalculated without generation bump (no duplicate notifications; COMPLETED/CLOSED history preserved).

### 9.5 Requests & Matches (FR-05, FR-14)

**Request statuses:** `OPEN`, `FULFILLED`, `CANCELLED`, `EXPIRED`. Matching is an *operation* against an active request, not a permanent request status.

- Requestor may edit or cancel an OPEN request; authorized officers may intervene administratively.
- Auto-expiry: after the needed date/time passes, a request becomes EXPIRED and is removed from active matching, notifications, and the demand map.
- Changes to matching-affecting fields (blood type, location, urgency, needed date/time, quantity) trigger matching re-evaluation and reconciliation of existing matches without duplicates.

**Match statuses:** `POTENTIAL`, `NOTIFIED`, `RESPONDED`, `COMPLETED`.

- Donor response transitions `POTENTIAL`/`NOTIFIED` → `RESPONDED`.
- **Multiple donors may remain engaged in parallel** while a request is open; accepting one donor does not cancel others (backups until FULFILLED).
- When a request becomes FULFILLED/CANCELLED/EXPIRED, remaining unresolved matches close accordingly.
- `COMPLETED` requires the donation to pass the donation-confirmation workflow (§9.6).

### 9.6 Donor Availability, Standby & Cooldowns (FR-09, FR-12, FR-13)

Availability statuses: `Available`, `Unavailable`, `Standby`, `Deactivated`.

**Donation confirmation workflow (authoritative trigger):**

1. Donor submits a donation report (self-report alone is insufficient).
2. An authorized Chapter Officer confirms the donation.
3. Confirmation records `last_verified_donation_at` and triggers the post-donation states below.

**Two independent time-based rules:**

| Rule | Trigger | Duration | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Post-donation standby | Officer-confirmed donation | ~**42 hours** (temporary) | Donor temporarily excluded from matching |
| Inter-donation cooldown | Officer-confirmed donation (`last_verified_donation_at`) | Configurable, ≈**3 months** per Philippine guidance | Donor ineligible for new matches until lapsed |

- **Non-response to a request does NOT trigger any standby.**
- Both rules are administrative platform rules; actual medical eligibility remains with the donating facility.
- Cooldowns **cannot be bypassed** by self-reactivation; they are enforced automatically by the backend.
- **Reactivation:** donors may toggle ordinary availability themselves, but only where no system-enforced state blocks them (post-donation standby, cooldown). Administrative deactivation requires an authorized Chapter Officer or System Administrator to lift.
- Verification status and donor availability are **independent states**; reactivation never resets verification status.
- > **Resolved conflict note:** early drafts described the 42-hour rule as a *non-response penalty*. Ruled out 2026-08-26: the 42-hour period is exclusively post-donation standby.

### 9.7 Notifications & Channels (FR-16, FR-17)

**Deduplication rule:** at most **one match notification per donor per request per matching generation**. A new generation is created only when a material change could alter the match set: required blood type, location, chapter/outreach scope, urgency, needed date/time, or other eligibility-affecting conditions. Re-runs without material change generate nothing; a donor becoming newly eligible for an existing request is a new match event and may be notified.

**Channels:**

- **In-app notification center:** dedicated notification records with read/unread status and timestamps.
- **Email:** separate channel for defined important events — critical matches, verification decisions, request/account-status changes.

**Critical-request outreach:** notify all currently eligible compatible donors within the defined outreach scope (cross-chapter included). No arbitrary small recipient cap; dedup + rate-limiting prevent duplicates from repeated events/runs. Critical notifications may send immediately, including off-hours, respecting user settings and platform delivery limits. Outreach stops when the request is FULFILLED, CANCELLED, or EXPIRED.

### 9.8 Privacy & Data Exposure (cross-cutting)

**Before a donor responds**, the requestor sees only: display name/first name, chapter, verification/availability status, approximate distance.

Hidden unless explicitly disclosed by the donor: exact address, coordinates, phone number, email address, identification documents, donor-card documents.

- After a response, communication stays in-system; direct contact details remain hidden unless the donor chooses to disclose them.
- Donor discovery is **request-scoped only** — there is no freely browsable member/donor directory, and members cannot obtain others' blood types, contacts, exact locations, or profiles.
- Officers/Administrators get broader access only to the extent necessary for authorized duties.

### 9.9 Regional Blood Demand Map (FR-15)

- Displays **aggregated counts of currently OPEN requests at chapter level, grouped by blood type**.
- Never displays individual request locations, requestor identities, exact coordinates, or pins.
- Access: authorized Chapter Officers and System Administrators only.
- Trend windows: default **30 days**; optional 7-day, 90-day, custom ranges.

### 9.10 Audit Logging (FR-18)

Append-only audit log. Mandatory events include: registration; login success/failure; logout; password-reset events; verification decisions; request creation/edit/cancellation/fulfillment/expiration; donation reports & confirmations; availability/standby/cooldown/reactivation changes; role or chapter changes; administrative overrides; cross-chapter authorizations; other significant security/system actions.

Record contents: timestamp, actor/account reference, action, target record (where applicable), relevant context — without unnecessarily storing sensitive document contents.

Viewership tiers: System Administrator = full log; Chapter Officer = chapter-relevant subset; members = none.

### 9.11 Analytics (FR-19)

Required metrics (from transactional data only, never manually entered values): request volume/trends; requests by blood type and chapter; fulfillment/cancellation/expiration rates; donor availability/status; verification activity; chapter engagement. Secondary (only if reliably derivable): time-to-first-response, donor response rate. CSV/export is **not** required unless separately approved.

### 9.12 Officer Dashboard (FR-20)

Primary work queues, in order:

1. Pending member/donor verifications within the officer's chapter
2. Donation reports awaiting confirmation
3. Active blood requests requiring monitoring/admin attention

Officers see full requestor identity within their own chapter when necessary for duties (data-minimization applies). Cross-chapter requestor information requires appropriate authorization/System Administrator access.

### 9.13 Chapters & Officer Assignment

- Three fixed chapters stored as **seeded reference data** in a dedicated chapters table: Mt. Samat (Orani), Mt. Tarak (Mariveles), Meridian Heights (Balanga City).
- Not createable/editable/deletable through normal administrative functions.
- Each Chapter Officer is assigned to **exactly one chapter**; ordinary authority is restricted to that chapter's members, requests, and verifications.
- System Administrators manage officer assignments and system-wide administration.

### 9.14 Privacy Notices (implemented)

- Registration Privacy Notice: mandatory acknowledgment (`privacy_acknowledged=true`); frontend checkbox + modal (`PrivacyNoticeModal.jsx`, `RegisterPage.jsx`) and backend gate (`AuthService::isPrivacyAcknowledged`, `POST /api/register` 400 + field error when missing/false/invalid).
- ID-upload Privacy Notice: mandatory acknowledgment on `POST /api/profile/documents` (`DocumentController`, `privacy_acknowledged` 400 + field error when missing/false); frontend enforced in `ProfilePage.jsx`.
- No invented retention/consent-persistence claims beyond the implemented acknowledgment gates and audit events.

### 9.15 Profile Pictures (implemented, migration 015)

- Nullable `users.profile_picture` (64-hex server-generated filename in `backend/storage/profile_pictures`, NULL when none).
- Upload through Profile (`POST /api/profile/picture`): JPG/PNG/WEBP ≤5 MB, MIME + `getimagesize` validation, 10/5-min rate limit, replacement deletes previous file, `profile.picture_updated` audited.
- Retrieval: `profile_picture_url` (`/api/profile/picture?v=...`) on login/me/profile; `GET /api/profile/picture` streams owner-only bytes (404 when none/invalid/missing); navbar `NavbarAvatar` shows avatar or fallback `User` icon.
- Pictures do not affect verification, matching, or eligibility.

### 9.16 Location Distinctions (implemented, migration 016)

- User Profile Location (`users.location_id`): approximate administrative location for donor proximity ranking, distance calculation, and donor-location reconciliation. Set via `LocationSelector.jsx` → `PUT /api/profile`.
- Blood Request Location (`blood_requests.location_id`): facility location where blood is needed, set via selector → `POST /api/requests` / `PUT /api/requests/{id}`; optional (null keeps proximity skipped for that request); location edit is material (coords re-resolved, `request.material_change`, regeneration).
- Chapter Canonical Centroid (`chapters.latitude/longitude`): chapter-level reference for Demand Map aggregation only — never a donor/request location, never individual pins/identities.

## 10. Verified Implementation Status

> **Specification ≠ implementation.** A feature described anywhere in this document is NOT implemented until its code has been inspected and verified in this repository. Statuses may only advance to ⚠️/✅ after inspecting committed application code.

### 10.0 Repository Audit (2026-08-26 — Historical baseline)

> Historical record: describes the working tree on 2026-08-26. Preserved unchanged for audit trail. For the current system (migrations 001–016, 12/12 suites green, 343 assertions), see §10.3 Post-Phase-17 additions and `docs/test-log-location.md`.

Full working-tree inspection found (on 2026-08-26):

- Files present: `AGENTS.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `skills-lock.json`, agent skills under `.agents/` — **nothing else**
- Branch `main` has **zero commits** (`git log`: "current branch 'main' does not have any commits yet")
- Glob for `*.php`, `*.js`, `*.jsx`, `*.sql`, `*.html`, `*.json` (excluding skills config): **no application source files**
- No database schema, migrations, dumps, endpoints, or React components exist in this repository

**Consequence:** every feature below is classified ❌ Not Implemented. Earlier drafts of this file carried "existing/implemented" claims inherited from the original project narrative; those claims are **withdrawn** until corresponding code exists and is verified here.

**Shared evidence for all rows:** no files/components/endpoints/database tables exist to cite — see Repository Audit above.

## 11. Technical Constraints

| Constraint | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Stack (required)** | HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, PHP, MySQL, XAMPP |
| **Laravel** | Do **not** introduce Laravel unless explicitly instructed |
| **MySQL port** | Runs through XAMPP on port **3307**, NOT 3306 |
| **Architecture** | Do not replace the existing architecture without a specific reason |

---

## 12. Development Guardrails

1. **Do not invent requirements.**
2. **Do not remove or reinterpret** functional and non-functional requirements.
3. **Distinguish implemented vs. planned features.** If existing code shows a feature isn't implemented, say so.
4. **Inspect the existing project** before making claims about what is already implemented.
5. **Enforce authorization on the backend.** Never rely solely on hiding buttons in React — a user must not reach an admin endpoint by manually entering its URL. Backend routes must verify: authentication, session, role, verification status (where required), and authorization.
6. **Keep compatibility/matching logic centralized on the backend** — never duplicated in frontend components, page scripts, or SQL queries.
7. **Preserve historical data** — prefer soft-deactivation over deletion.
