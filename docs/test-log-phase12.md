## Chapter Canonical Conventions Verified

- Fixed Seeded Reference Data in `chapters`:
  - `ID 1`: `mt_samat` — **Mt. Samat Chapter** — **Orani** (Centroid: 14.800300, 120.533600)
  - `ID 2`: `mt_tarak` — **Mt. Tarak Chapter** — **Mariveles** (Centroid: 14.435000, 120.486700)
  - `ID 3`: `meridian_heights` — **Meridian Heights Chapter** — **Balanga City** (Centroid: 14.676500, 120.536100)
- Canonical display format `{name} ({municipality})` verified across all APIs and UIs.

## Endpoints Verified

| Endpoint | Access | Verified Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/demand-map` | Admin, Officer | Returns aggregated chapter-level demand for active `OPEN` requests only (excludes `FULFILLED`, `CANCELLED`, `EXPIRED`). Grouped by ABO/Rh blood type and urgency. Coordinates match canonical chapter centroids only. No individual request pins, coordinates, or identities are leaked. Scoped to assigned chapter for Officers (Admin sees all 3 chapters). Members receive 403; Unauthenticated receive 401. |
| `GET /api/analytics/summary` | Admin, Officer | Single-pass SQL aggregation of request volume, status distribution, resolution rates, blood type demand, urgency demand, daily trends, donor pool availability, verification activity, and donation engagement. Scoped to assigned chapter for Officers (Admin supports global and `?chapter_id=` filtering). |
| `GET /api/officer/dashboard` | Chapter Officer | Operational dashboard scoped strictly to authenticated officer's assigned chapter. Returns pending member verifications count, pending donation reports count, active `OPEN` requests, total units needed, donor pool availability, chapter demand by blood type, and recent chapter activity stream. Cross-chapter parameter tampering (`?chapter_id=other`) is rejected with 403. |
| `GET /api/admin/dashboard` | System Admin | Global platform dashboard returning total users, active requests, fulfillment metrics, system-wide pending queues, cross-chapter comparison table (all 3 chapters), global donor pool status, and recent system-wide audit stream. |

## Rate Calculation Formulas Verified

1. **Resolution Denominator:** Strictly equals `FULFILLED + CANCELLED + EXPIRED` requests. `OPEN` requests are excluded from the denominator.
2. **Fulfillment Rate:** `FULFILLED / (FULFILLED + CANCELLED + EXPIRED) * 100`.
3. **Cancellation Rate:** `CANCELLED / (FULFILLED + CANCELLED + EXPIRED) * 100`.
4. **Expiration Rate:** `EXPIRED / (FULFILLED + CANCELLED + EXPIRED) * 100`.
5. **Empty State:** When resolved requests = 0, rates evaluate to `0.0%`.

## Donor Pool Availability Verified

- Evaluated against authoritative `DonorEligibilityService` rules across active, verified, enrolled member records.
- Donors in active post-donation standby window (~42 hours) correctly classified as `standby`.
- Donors in active inter-donation cooldown window (~90 days) correctly classified as `cooldown`.
- Donors with explicit `unavailable` status classified as `unavailable`.
- Unblocked donors with `available` or expired windows classified as `available` (matchable).

## Frontend Components & Pages Verified

- **`DemandMapPage.jsx` (`/demand-map`):** Regional blood demand viewer with filter controls (Blood Type, Urgency, Time Window), summary metric cards, and chapter demand cards showing ABO/Rh breakdowns and centroid coordinates.
- **`OfficerDashboardPage.jsx` (`/officer/dashboard`):** Operational dashboard for Chapter Officers with pinned chapter badge, operational action queue cards (Verifications, Confirmations, Active Requests), blood type demand grid, donor pool breakdown, and recent chapter audit stream.
- **`AdminDashboardPage.jsx` (`/admin/dashboard`):** System-wide administration overview with platform KPI cards, request lifecycle breakdown, cross-chapter comparison table, and system-wide audit stream.
- **`AnalyticsPage.jsx` (`/analytics`):** Detailed analytics reporting page with custom date range picker, preset buttons (7d, 30d, 90d), chapter filter (for admins), rate cards, categorical tables, and daily trend tables.
- **Navigation & Routing (`App.jsx`):** Navigation links and routes added with role-gated visibility.
- **Build Validation:** `npm run build` executed cleanly with zero errors.
